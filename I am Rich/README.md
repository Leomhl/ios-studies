# I am Rich

I am Rich is a very simple project to start my studies using Swift and XCode to create ios mobile apps. Basically, I am Rich has a diamond image, a label with the text "I am Rich" and an application icon configured. The main idea of this app is to simulate the original I am Rich app created several years ago when the first iPhone was annunciated.
